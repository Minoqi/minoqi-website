# About
Hello! My names Minoqi, also known as [Freelance Felix](https://freelancefelix.com), welcome to my blog! I primarily post game programming tutorials and devlogs, with the occassional random topic.

Currently working ony my first solo published game, ***The 10-Day Garden!*** Originally made for the [GMTK 2024 Game Jam](https://minoqi.itch.io/the-10-day-garden), people really liked it so I've decided to finish it up and post it on steam.
