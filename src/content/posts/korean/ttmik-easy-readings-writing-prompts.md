Mini essays are a great way to improve your output in korean but coming up with ideas can be difficult. So I've come up with a writing prompt to go with each story in the `TTMIK Easy Korean Readings for Beginners` book, that way you can practice not only your input but also output!

You can check your writing either with your tutor, a friend or by using an app like `HelloTalk` or `Hi Native` as well as the website `LangCorrect`. I recommend you ***DON'T*** use AI for writing and checking.

:::tip
Try to use the new vocabulary you learned from the story in your mini essay.
