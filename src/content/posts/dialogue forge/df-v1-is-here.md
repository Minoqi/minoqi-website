Version 1.0 is here! It feels so nice to have a working version of this tool out there, ready to be used for projects. I wanted my new website to be ready, but it is unfortunately down at the time of writing this... I will work to get it up and running as quickly as possible though! Anyways, lets go over the changes:

1. Minos Dialogue Manager is now called Dialogue Forge!

2. Each line under a label must have a '- " added to the beginning of the line, otherwise it will be skipped in exports!

3. The export format has changed for easier parsing, this applies to the save file too so previous save files WILL NOT work

4. Translation support is here! Ctrl + T to create a translation ID for that line

5. Multi-file support! Easily swap between dialogue files from the project, no need to open and close files constantly :)

I plan on making a trailer as well as a tutorial video soon for people to reference. I have some things on my roadmap that I'd like to complete as well, but my main focus will be on getting parser addons available for Godot and Unity first to work with the default labels and easy to expand upon as needed.
