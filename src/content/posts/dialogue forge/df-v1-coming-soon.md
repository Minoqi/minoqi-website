Good news, the official Ver 1 release is set to come out within a week! This comes with many changes, which I will detail in the official release post, but here's a quick rundown and what to expect:

1. Save system and exports got an overhaul in how the data is stored, so any previous files will  not work in V1.0!

2. Added support for swapping between dialogues easily without the need to open a separate file

3. Added translation support!

4. Brand new website is being made, with a detailed docs list and some example files

5. A brand overhaul will be included for the V1.0 release, getting a rename from "Minos Dialogue Manager" to "Dialogue Forge"!

6. Once V1.0 is out, it will no longer be free and instead be $9.99 USD

I hope you look forward to the official release of V1.0! I know I am :)
