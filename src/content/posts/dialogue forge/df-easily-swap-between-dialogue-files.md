# File System Update!

I've recently updated the way files work! The entire project is still stored in a JSON file, but you can now store multiple dialogues in the same file, easily allowing you to hop between dialogues.  Next on the list is updating the file opening/exporting system to support this new save format. Once that's done I'll be adding in translation tags and the official V1 will be ready!
